# Q & A

## How does it work?

You have to figure that out yourself. The original Master PC program also did not come with a manual

## Can I suggest more options?

Sure, use the Issues tab at the top to do so.

## Help, someone transformed me and I can't figure out my default settings

You should have created a backup of your parameters and locked them. Sorry, it is too late now, I can't help you.

# Todo/Ideas:

* Nicer support for smaller screen sizes (right now you can resize the boxes to fit your screen, but it will not play nicely with phones/tablets)
* Make the backend actually work
* More options, maybe?
* Shareable link so you can watch live how someone messed with your profile, similar to [Switcher-Roo](https://qtderg.github.io/switcher-roo/)

Also, I don't guarantee that the code actually works as advertised. Or works as intended. Or works at all.
